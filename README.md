# CharacterManager

A simple (complicated) app to manage character sheets and inventory for a DnD style campaign

If you would like to contribute feel free to add more skills and items

Skills: just add a new skill (copy Perception) and call the contructor parameter the name of the skill roll

Items: add a new item and an item from string handler for it (copy ShortSword and ShortSwordFromStringHadler, don't worry too much about
the ItemUseCommand, it's a work in progress)
